# Fake News Detection

This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based classifier to identify whether a news article is **real** or **fake** using machine learning techniques.

## Overview
Fake news can cause significant harm in public opinion and trust. This project uses TF-IDF and machine learning models like Logistic Regression to detect fake news based on the article text.

## üõ† Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- NLTK (for text cleaning)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
Used a labeled dataset of real and fake news articles.  
üìÅ `news.csv` contains the text and label.
